## How to Install Ubuntu
There are three ways to install Ubuntu.

### 1. Replace Current OS with Ubuntu
This is the simplest and easiest method to install Ubuntu. You will have to erase your whole hard drive and replace your current OS with Ubuntu. We do not recommend this method.

### 2. Dual Boot Ubuntu Alongside Windows
This way you partition your hard drive into two parts: one where Windows is installed and the other where Ubuntu is installed. At boot time you select which OS you want to boot into. When choosing this method be careful and follow instructions carefully as there is a chance of you corrupting your hard drive.
